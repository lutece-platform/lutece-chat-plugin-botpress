## Introduction

This plugins lets embed BotPress bots into the Lutece site

The integration is based on the [Lutete Chatbot plugin](https://github.com/lutece-platform/lutece-chat-plugin-chatbot) providing the conversational UI.

Three modes of integration are possible:
 
* mode 1: The Chatbot is in the form of a web page (classic XPage)
* mode 2: The Chatbot comes in a popup that opens with a button at the bottom right of any page of the site
* mode 3: The Chatbot is integrated in *iframe* in another site


To integrate a BotPress bot the only information needed is its identifier and the address of the server

## Configuration
